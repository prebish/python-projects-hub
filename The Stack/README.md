# Memory Part 1: The Stack

## Overview
The stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science, used extensively in both theoretical and practical applications. It operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first to be removed. This project, "The Stack," focuses on understanding and implementing this data structure through the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi.

## Description
### Why Stacks?
A stack is like a pile of plates where you can only add or remove the top plate. This simple yet powerful structure is crucial for tasks such as function call management, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms in software applications. The primary operations of a stack are:

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
- **Peek**: Look at the top element without removing it.

### Historical Context
The concept of a stack has been around since the early days of computer science and continues to be a key topic in both academic and applied contexts. Its development paralleled the evolution of computing, especially in areas like memory management and algorithm design.

### The Towers of Hanoi
While the Towers of Hanoi is an ancient puzzle, it serves as an excellent practical example of stack usage. In this game, players move disks between three pegs (or towers) following specific rules, mimicking stack operations. The game illustrates the stack's LIFO behavior and recursive problem-solving.

## Getting Started
### Project Contents
- `stack.py`: Module for the stack data structure. **(DO NOT MODIFY)**
- `hanoi.py`: The main game logic for the Towers of Hanoi. You will work in this file.
- `solution_hanoi.py`: A complete solution to the Towers of Hanoi game. **(DO NOT MODIFY)**
- `test_hanoi.py`: The test suite for verifying the functionality of the Towers of Hanoi implementation. **(DO NOT MODIFY)**

### Running the Project
You are encouraged to run the game provided in the `solution_hanoi.py` file to better understand how the game is supposed to work in additon to how a stack operates in a real-world scenario. To maximize learning, make sure to not look at the source code in the solution file unless you are stuck and have given it your best shot.

## Conclusion
The stack is a versatile and essential data structure in computer science. Through "The Stack" project, you gain practical experience with stacks, learning how to implement them and seeing their application in solving problems like the Towers of Hanoi. This experience will be invaluable in both your studies and future software development endeavors.
